# 207-Final-Project

A description of the problem domain your team is tentatively wanting to focus on in the project. (e.g., trivia, finance, real estate, etcâ€¦)
a brief, high-level description of what kind of application your team is thinking of developing.
This is mostly just so we can give you some initial feedback on whether your team might want to reconsider your project direction.
a link to the documentation for an API your team can use related to the domain.




a screenshot of using a tool to try out the API (like https://www.postman.com/Links to an external site. or https://hoppscotch.io/Links to an external site.Links to an external site.)
example output of running your Java code (see below).


Some technical problems that we were experiencing are related to the website that we are accessing the API on.
They ask for information that we do not know such as specification of image delay in the optimization process or the ID_size.
It may be easier to switch APIs, especially since there are many options for our given problem domain.

Here is the code that we generated from API Layer after obtaining a token for this API.
## Java Code ##

import requests

url = "https://api.apilayer.com/image_upload/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Di%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.goal.com%252Fen%252Fnews%252Fwhy-did-cristiano-ronaldo-leave-real-madrid-for-juventus%252F1xzscq6gfxb8n15976p2yuyi8j%26psig%3DAOvVaw05dklKF5_9-ANjSyAA8SQy%26ust%3D1696290513167000%26source%3Dimages%26cd%3Dvfe%26opi%3D89978449%26ved%3D0CBEQjRxqFwoTCPCxtN2E1oEDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE&delay=False"

payload = "{body}".encode("utf-8")
headers= {
"apikey": "LBBA6IIrFb2DVuwbdYYZuWNwYVft46nf"
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data = payload)

status_code = response.status_code
result = response.text

####

The output of running this program is: {"error":{"code":"validation_error","message":"Request failed with validation error","context":{"delay":["The delay field must be true or false."],"callback":["The callback must be a valid URL."],"lost":["The lost field must be true or false."],"enhance":["The enhance field must be true or false."]}}}

This is because we are unable to satisfy all the requirements to generate the image. They ask for information that we are unsure
about, such as specification for an image delay in the optimization process or the ID_size. We inputted what we could but ultimately
we could not get the API call to work. We will likely switch APIs if these problems persist.
