The broad purpose of the proposed software is to develop a chat system where users can send and receive messages, create group chats, edit messages, and search through messages.

Software Specification:

The program should have features relating to user registration, creating and sending messages, and storing/searching for messages.

User Registration and Authentication:

- The program will provide a user registration system, allowing new users to create accounts.
- Users will be required to provide a unique username and a secure password during the registration process.
- The system will support user authentication, allowing registered users to log in securely.
- The user interface will include features for composing messages, searching through messages, and viewing chat history.
  
Message Creation and Sending:

- Registered users will have the ability to compose and send messages to other registered users.
- Messages will consist of text and may include additional metadata, such as timestamps and message IDs.
- The system will validate the recipient's username to ensure that the message is sent to an existing user.
 
Message Storage and Retrieval:

- The program will maintain a message database to store all chat messages.
- Messages will be organized by conversation threads or chat rooms,
allowing users to participate in multiple conversations.
- Users will have the ability to retrieve and view their chat history, including
old messages, by searching for specific keywords or phrases.
- Access control mechanisms will ensure that only certain users can access
and interact with specific chat rooms or conversations. User Stories:
